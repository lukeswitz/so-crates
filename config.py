# this value. DEFAULT_UPLOAD_SIZE is what's used when no override is sent
# (preserves the old fixed ceiling for any caller that doesn't opt in).

# Rules freshness
# Zircolite-Rules-v2 and Emerging Threats Open both ship (roughly) daily;
# YARA Forge ships weekly. A single shared threshold can't match all
# three cadences at once, and this is tuned toward catching the two daily
# feeds falling behind promptly rather than toward YARA Forge's slower
# one - this was 7 days (a "wait for a whole missed YARA Forge release"
# ceiling) until reconsidered, since that let Sigma/Suricata coverage
# silently drift for most of a week (6+ missed daily releases) before
# anyone was told, which was judged worse than occasionally flagging
# YARA a few days before its own release cadence would strictly warrant.
# It's the single source of truth for "how old is too old", read by:
#   - get_suricata_rules_info()/get_yara_rules_info()/get_sigma_rules_info()
#     ('stale' field), which drives both static/socrates.js's opt-in
#     checkForStaleRules() notification and the Rules modal's own
#     amber-date warning (isRulesetStale()/formatDateSpan(), which read it
#     via /api/rules-info's staleThresholdHours rather than hardcoding
#     their own separate threshold - the two used to disagree, 24h vs a
#     30-day frontend-only constant, until they were unified here).
# Note: is_file_stale(rules_file, RULES_MAX_AGE_HOURS) is also still
# computed inside setup_yara_rules()/setup_sigma_rules() to decide whether
# to attempt an actual network refresh, but as of the network-consent
# changes described in AGENTS.md's "Detection Rule Freshness" section,
# every current caller passes either force=True (the value doesn't matter,
# force short-circuits it) or network_allowed=False (the download branch
# is unreachable either way) - so that particular check is presently dead
# code, kept only because a future caller with network_allowed=True,
