    listed in the default eve-log `types` block - confirmed against the
    shipped /etc/suricata/suricata.yaml (only pgsql is listed there, and it's
    disabled by default). This helper turns on the pgsql logger and adds the
    others just before the `stats` entry so they appear as standalone events.

    'enip'/'ntp' history: this app originally shipped on Suricata 7.0.10,
    where their app-layer parsers detected traffic fine (confirmed: a real
    NTP capture showed 15 flows correctly tagged app_proto=ntp) but neither
    had an eve-log *output module* compiled in at all - `No output module
    named eve-log.ntp`/`eve-log.enip` at startup, zero events regardless of
    config. Checked against Suricata's own source: rust/src/ntp/ had no
    log.rs and rust/src/enip/ didn't exist yet at the `suricata-7.0.10` tag.
    Now that this app runs on Suricata 8.0.6 (enip logging landed in 8.0.0,
    ntp logging in 8.0.5 - confirmed against those release tags), both
    loggers exist and 'enip'/'ntp' are back in the default tuple for real.
    If this ever runs against an older Suricata again, re-check for the
    `No output module` warning before assuming this config change does
    anything.

    REGRESSION (independent of the enip/ntp version history above): this
    used to be one regex requiring `- pgsql:` to be followed only by
    indented property lines up to `- stats:`. That's true only on a pristine
    config - once a previous run had already inserted bare `- modbus:` /
    `- dnp3:` header lines in between (exactly what this function itself
    does), the regex could never match again, so re-running setup on an
    already-provisioned install would silently stop adding any newly-added
    protocol at all (confirmed by reproducing it: re-running against a real
    already-processed suricata.yaml added nothing, while the same code
    worked fine against a pristine /etc/suricata/suricata.yaml). Enabling
    pgsql's logger and inserting the missing bare headers are now two
    independent, idempotent steps instead of one fragile combined regex, so
    this is safe to call repeatedly and safe to extend with new protocols
    whenever that becomes appropriate.
