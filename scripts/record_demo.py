"""Record docs/videos/demo.mp4 against a locally running SO-CRATES server.

Requires: pip install -r requirements-screenshots.txt, plus a one-time
`playwright install ffmpeg` (Playwright's video muxing needs its own bundled
ffmpeg, separate from any system ffmpeg). Also needs a running server
(default http://127.0.0.1:8000/socrates.html - override with --base-url).
Uses the app's own built-in "Sample pcap file" (DEFAULT_SAMPLE_URL in
static/socrates.js), same as scripts/capture_screenshots.py, so it needs no
pre-existing local analysis or hardcoded MD5 - it works on a clean checkout
with an empty DATA_DIR. Pointing the server's DATA_DIR at one that's already
analyzed that same sample skips straight to the "ready" response (see
_commit_file_or_return_ready in socrates.py) instead of re-running Suricata/
Sigma/YARA, and is also the only way to get real Playbook/AI Summary
content in the recording, since playbook_lookup.py/ai_summary_lookup.py
read from PLAYBOOKS_DIR//usr/share/playbooks and AI_SUMMARIES_DIR//usr/
share/ai-summaries (Docker-image-baked, not part of DATA_DIR).

Each caption() call can optionally take a target (a Playwright Locator) -
see point_to()/DRAW_ARROW_JS - which draws an amber arrow from the caption
box to whatever it's currently describing, so a caption never leaves it
ambiguous which stat card/button/row it refers to. Caption styling uses a
solid on-brand blue rather than translucent black specifically so it stays
legible against the app's own near-black UI (see CAPTION_JS's own comment).

Playwright's own video muxing can only record to WebM, but that raw
recording is treated as a discarded intermediate, not a published asset -
it's immediately re-encoded to H.264/AAC MP4 via a system `ffmpeg` binary,
since MP4 is universally browser-supported (unlike WebM, whose Safari/iOS
support is spotty) and is also the format required to upload the same clip
directly to X/Instagram/LinkedIn/Facebook, none of which accept WebM. A
still frame is also extracted to docs/videos/demo-poster.jpg, used as the
<video poster> on the Home page so it doesn't show a blank white square
before playback. If ffmpeg isn't found on PATH, the raw WebM is saved to
docs/videos/demo.webm as a last-resort fallback instead, with a warning -
better than no video at all, but docs/index.md's <video> tag would need a
matching <source> added back until ffmpeg is available and this script is
re-run.
